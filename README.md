# About Me
## My Interests
I like cars and most things mechanical, I like computers, and I play video games on occasion.
## Websites I recommend
- [Youtube](www.youtube.com) - Youtube is useful to me becuase I can find a tutorial or explanation of most things that interest me or that I am having issues with.

- [Ebay](www.ebay.com) - Ebay is useful to me because it allows me to find rare pieces and componenets that are difficult to find elsewhere.
